	   which gets two monsoons each year, and is one of the wettest places in the country.Large numbers of people make the excursion from Colombo at weekends to enjoy
	   the beautiful scenery, play in the river, and to have an excellent rice-curry lunch at the local restaurants.
       The Kelani River is wide at Kitulgala, but it is shallow apart from a deep channel near the opposite bank. So, in the drier months, it provides a safe and attractive place to swim and play. 
       It is a base for white-water rafting, which starts a few kilometers upstream.</p>

	  Before the Bo Falls the water flows through rocks to form two distinct streams and cascades 
	  into a large rock pool, where it exits through a 2m opening.
      This is a popular bathing and picnic location among the locals.
