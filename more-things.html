           <b>History</b><br>
            This church was built in 1852 as a small shrine but transformed into a major church with subsequent expansions and renovations
            (Abeyawardana, 2002). In 1867, a school by the name of St Mary's School was established in connection with 
            this church to provide education in English as well as in national languages (Abeyawardana, 2002). The school
            was taken over by the Government in 1960 (Abeyawardana, 2002).</p>
